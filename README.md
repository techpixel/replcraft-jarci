# replcraft-jarci
Just Another Replcraft Implementation (*In Python!*)

## Supports v1.5.0
- Fuel Info API
- moveItem Target Index Support
- Transact Support

## Note
This library attempts to implement replcraft through a long-term connection system, similar to the javascript library. The downside to this is that it is not as versatile as a short term connection.

Try [replcraft-rexum](https://pypi.org/project/replcraft-rexum/) for a more versatile approach. This doesn't include transact support however.
